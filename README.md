The concept for this project is to create an application that helps connect animal shelters and dogs with people. It will be designed to allow users to meet and host dogs for a length of time (a few hours, a day, etc.) from local animal shelters. For those who do not have the time, money, or capability to care for an animal, but love the companionship of one, this application will give them the opportunity to connect with animals. Animal shelters will benefit because they will have an increase in volunteers, and animal shelters might be less full. Dogs will also benefit because they will be able to socialize and experience life outside of an animal shelter. Hopefully this application will lead to adoptions, which would help dogs, people, and animal shelters.

## API and Framework Integrations
This app utilizes the following: 
- [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/)
